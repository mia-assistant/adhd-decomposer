- Restore purchases must work
- No "bait and switch" between free/paid features
- Subscription terms must be clear

### 3. Privacy
- Request only necessary permissions
- Explain why each permission is needed (done in Info.plist)
- No data collection without disclosure

### 4. Performance
- App must not crash
- Must work without network (offline functionality)
- Must handle edge cases gracefully
