## Setting Up Siri Shortcuts

### Automatic Setup
Siri Shortcuts are automatically available after you install Tiny Steps on iOS 16 or later. The more you use the app, the smarter Siri gets at suggesting these shortcuts.

### Manual Setup via Shortcuts App
1. Open the **Shortcuts** app on your iPhone
2. Tap **Gallery** at the bottom
3. Search for "Tiny Steps"
4. You'll see the available shortcuts for the app
5. Tap the **+** button to add any shortcut
6. Customize the trigger phrase if desired

### Adding to Siri Suggestions
The app automatically "donates" intents to Siri when you:
- Complete a task (suggests starting another)
- Use a routine (suggests it for next time)
- View your stats (suggests checking progress)

This helps Siri learn your patterns and offer relevant suggestions.

## Troubleshooting

### Voice commands aren't working

1. **Check iOS version**: Siri Shortcuts require iOS 16.0 or later
2. **Enable Siri**: Go to Settings → Siri & Search → enable "Listen for 'Hey Siri'"
3. **Check app permissions**: Settings → Tiny Steps → Siri & Search → enable all toggles
4. **Restart the app**: Close and reopen Tiny Steps
5. **Try different phrasing**: Say "with Tiny Steps" clearly at the end

### Siri says "I couldn't find that in Tiny Steps"

- Make sure you're using one of the supported phrases listed above
- Try adding "with Tiny Steps" at the end of your command
- Open Tiny Steps at least once after installation to register shortcuts

### Shortcuts appear in Suggestions but don't work

1. Open Tiny Steps manually once
2. Try the shortcut again
3. If it still doesn't work, reinstall the app

### "Continue my task" says no task found

You need an active (uncompleted) task. Try:
1. "Break down a task with Tiny Steps" first
2. Enter a task and decompose it
3. Then "Continue my task" will work

## Privacy Note

Siri Shortcuts work entirely on-device. Your task data and voice commands are not sent to Apple's servers beyond standard Siri processing. No task content is shared - only the action type (like "start new task") is communicated.

## Tips for ADHD Users

- **Morning routine**: Set up a Siri Automation to run "Start morning routine" at your wake-up time
- **Quick capture**: Use "Break down a task" when a thought hits you
- **Friction-free resume**: "Continue my task" gets you back to work without opening the app manually
- **Accountability**: Check "Show my progress" daily to build momentum

## Supported Languages

Siri Shortcuts work in all languages supported by your device's Siri settings. The app phrases are in English, but Siri will translate based on your language settings.
