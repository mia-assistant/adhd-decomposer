## Problem Statement

### Heading
**Sound familiar?**

You know what you need to do. You've written it down a hundred times. But when you look at "Clean the apartment" or "Start that project," your brain just... freezes.

It's not laziness. It's not lack of motivation. It's your brain struggling to see the first step.

**Tiny Steps fixes that.**

---

## Key Benefits

### Benefit 1: Break It Down
**🧩 From overwhelming to obvious**

Type any task. Tiny Steps instantly breaks it into small, concrete steps you can actually start.

"Do taxes" becomes:
- Open last year's return
- Gather W-2s
- Log into tax software
- Enter personal info
- ...and so on

No more paralysis. Just your next tiny step.

---

### Benefit 2: See Only What Matters
**👁️ Focus mode for scattered minds**

Hide the mountain. See only the next step.

Tiny Steps shows you exactly one thing at a time—so your brain can stop worrying about everything else and just start.

---

### Benefit 3: Feel the Progress
**✨ Dopamine on demand**

Check off each tiny step and watch your progress grow. That little hit of "I did something" keeps you moving forward.

No more all-or-nothing. Every tiny win counts.

---

## How It Works

### Step 1
**Add your overwhelming task**
Type what's been stuck on your list forever. The scarier the better.

### Step 2
**Watch it break down**
Tiny Steps (with a little AI help) splits it into bite-sized steps. Edit them however you want.

### Step 3
**Do one tiny step**
Focus on just the first one. Check it off. Repeat.

### Step 4
**Celebrate every win**
Feel the satisfaction as your progress bar grows. You're doing it.

## Built for ADHD Minds

### Heading
**Made by someone who gets it**

I have ADHD. I built Tiny Steps because nothing else worked.

Regular to-do apps made me feel like a failure. They showed me everything I wasn't doing, with no help actually starting.

Tiny Steps is the tool I needed—and maybe you need it too.

## FAQ

### Q: Is this just for people with ADHD?
**A:** Not at all! While Tiny Steps is designed with ADHD brains in mind, anyone who struggles with procrastination, overwhelm, or "just starting" will find it helpful. If you've ever stared at a task and felt paralyzed, this is for you.

### Q: How does the task breakdown work?
**A:** You can break tasks down manually, or use our AI assistant to generate suggested steps. The AI understands context—so "Do taxes" generates different steps than "Plan birthday party." You can always edit, add, or remove steps.

### Q: Is my data private?
**A:** Absolutely. Your tasks stay on your device by default. If you use cloud sync, your data is encrypted. We never sell your information, and we never will.

### Q: Is it really free?
**A:** The core features are free forever—adding tasks, breaking them down, tracking progress. There's an optional premium tier for power users with extra features like AI-powered suggestions, cross-device sync, and detailed analytics. But you can use Tiny Steps completely free.

### Q: What makes this different from other task apps?
**A:** Most task apps are built for neurotypical brains. They assume if you write something down, you'll do it. Tiny Steps is designed around the reality that ADHD brains need help with the "starting" part—not just the "remembering" part.
