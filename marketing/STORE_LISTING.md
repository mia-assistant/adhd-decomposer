## App Title
Tiny Steps — ADHD Task Helper

## Short Description (80 chars)
Break down overwhelming tasks. Do them step by step. Built for ADHD.

## Full Description

You know what needs to be done. You just can't start.

Tiny Steps is different. Other apps give you a plan. We help you DO it.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Tell us what's overwhelming
2. AI breaks it into tiny steps (2-5 min each)
3. Do one step at a time with timers & encouragement
4. Done. No guilt. Just progress.

BUILT FOR ADHD BRAINS
• Time blindness alerts — "You've been on this 10 min"
• Step-by-step execution mode, not just lists
• Supportive tone — celebrates small wins
• Body double mode with ambient sounds
• Home screen widget — see your next step instantly
