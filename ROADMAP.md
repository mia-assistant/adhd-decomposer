## Design Principles (Never Compromise)
1. **One thing at a time** - Never overwhelm
2. **Celebrate everything** - Dopamine is the feature
3. **No guilt** - Skip button always available
4. **Calm UI** - Soft colors, rounded corners, breathing room
5. **Fast to value** - Task → steps in <3 seconds

## Technical Debt to Address
- [ ] Proper error handling throughout
- [ ] Offline mode (cache AI responses)
- [ ] Unit tests for providers
- [ ] Integration tests for key flows
- [ ] Analytics (Mixpanel/Amplitude)
- [ ] Crash reporting (Sentry/Crashlytics)
