# ADHD Task Decomposer - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Status:** MVP Development

---

## Overview

An ADHD-friendly mobile app that uses AI to break down overwhelming tasks into small, actionable steps and guides users through execution one step at a time with dopamine-friendly feedback.

### Problem Statement

People with ADHD struggle with:
- **Task overwhelm**: Big tasks feel impossible, causing paralysis
- **Time blindness**: Can't estimate task duration, lose track of time
- **Executive dysfunction**: Knowing what to do ≠ being able to start
- **Notification fatigue**: Traditional reminders get ignored

Existing solutions either stop at task breakdown (Goblin Tools) or are too complex/gamified (Habitica).

### Solution

A simple, calming app that:
1. Takes a task and AI-decomposes it into tiny actionable steps
2. Shows ONE step at a time (no overwhelming lists)
3. Provides timers and gentle guidance
4. Celebrates every small win with dopamine hits (confetti, sounds, encouragement)
5. Never guilts the user for skipping or taking breaks

---

## Target Audience

**Secondary:** Anyone who struggles with task overwhelm and procrastination

**User Persona:** 
- Has tried multiple to-do apps that didn't stick
- Feels overwhelmed by big tasks

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI costs at scale | Cache common tasks, rate limit, use GPT-4o-mini |
| Bad AI outputs | Feedback button, prompt refinement |
| Low retention | Focus on celebration/dopamine mechanics |
| Competition | Move fast, nail UX |

---

## Open Questions

1. App name? Options: TaskFlow, Chunk It, Tiny Steps, Decompose, FlowState
2. Mascot/character? Could add personality but also complexity
3. Onboarding flow length?

---

## Next Steps

1. Create Flutter project
2. Implement data models
3. Build AI service
4. Create basic UI screens
5. Iterate rapidly
